Seems like the watcher could be very useful to trigger events.
Visualization wouldn't really help as there is not enough data.
Ticketing system?


## SUPPORT SYSTEM
We can integrate with the help files.

### STATIC/GOALS DASHBOARD

Create a dashboard to answer questions about how people use the ticketing system:

* Do people look at the help docs?
* How are tickets distributed by priority?
* Show most relevant ticket pages
* Show ticket trends over long period (check if there are more tickets on release)
* Increase in help tickets from last month (show avg and percent increase)


### REALTIME/USABILITY DASHBOARD

Show realtime data about the ticketing system:

* Show trends in ticket priority (eg. sudden spike in high priority tickets)
* Show most recent critical tickets
* Show tends in ticket categories
* Find companies with most tickets (eg. in the past week)
* Increase in help tickets from yesterday
